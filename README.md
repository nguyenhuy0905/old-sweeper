# old-sweeper
I just found this project after 3 years. The memories. Also, do know this is just an archive of my fondest memory. It isn't even finished yet. 
## What didn't I finish yet
- A save game function. Hell, back then I didn't even know about JSON and/or XML yet.
- Code organization. Just take a look at the code and you know.
- Optimization. I mean, you can't ask an at-the-time beginner to optimize the code.
